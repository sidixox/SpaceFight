# SpaceFight

Hello, This is the creator of spacefight. This video take heavy inspitration from the japanese game 'spave invaders'. Though this is my final project for a class this game is has been one of my most favourite games.
this style of video game is kind of out of my style but some of the animation syle and prefabs and completely taken from youtube refernces linked below. The sound effects are quite loud so i recommend to not play it with full volume. 

Here is a video of me doign a progress check: it took forever to understand layering. Because my missile were not shooting whatsoever which was quite frustrating.

Final demo run: This video shows my gameplay, and I believe it's the best I can achieve within the given timeframe. I attempted to change the fonts, but the assets wouldn't download without the package. Since my project is due tonight, I won't have time to tweak my code further. Perhaps after I receive my grade, I'll consider releasing a full level game. Thank you for your patience, and I'll see you when I have updates.
