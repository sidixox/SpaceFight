# SpaceFight\

Hello, This is the creator of spacefight. This video take heavy inspitration from the japanese game 'spave invaders'. Though this is my final project for a class this game is has been one of my most favourite games.
this style of video game is kind of out of my style but some of the animation syle and prefabs and completely taken from youtube refernces linked below. The sound effects are quite loud so i recommend to not play it with full volume. 

Here is a video of me doign a progress check: it took forever to understand layering. Because my missile were not shooting whatsoever which was quite frustrating.

Final demop run: This video is from me playing it. I think this is the best i can do with the time frame. i tried changing fonts but the assest wouldnt download without the package, since my project is due tonight i will not play around with my code. Maybe after i get my grade in this class, i will release a level game. Thank you for your paitance, see ya when i update.
